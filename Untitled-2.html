        <h4>Career Goal:</h4>
        <p>
            Ever since the day I was born I knew it was my destiny to become the most infamous man in the digital world. My personal goal is to
            become a game developer and I would like to publish games that become well known on Steam and other platforms. I would also be 
            interested in working for companies. I will achieve this goal by learning the most essential coding languages. I will start by making
            smaller projects until my projects get greater in scale. For example, I can start by making an easy clicking game and one day I am 
            going to make Fortnite v2.
        </p>

        <h4>Strengths/Qualities and Achievements:</h4>
        <p>
            I possess great problem solving skills and perseverance. These skills will help me greatly in the coding career path I
            want to pursue because problem solving skills will help me debug my code to make it work if there are errors, and my 
            perseverance will help me not give up when I receive those bugs.
        <p>
            One of my biggest achievements so far in high school is my participation in the Emerald High School basketball team in 
            freshman year. Through this experience I learned the importance of hard work and that nothing comes easy in life. This
            caused me to put hard work in school and learning coding languages. Also, like my coach always said, you can not cut 
            corners to achieve greatness.        
        </p>

        <h4>Conclusion:</h4>
        <p>
            Thank you for taking the time to learn more about my aspirations and strengths that will help me in my coding career. 
            I am always ready to learn and excited about the future and the possibilities that lie ahead for me.
        </p>
